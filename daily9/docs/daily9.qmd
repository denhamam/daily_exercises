```{r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
library(tidyverse)
library(visdat)
```

## 2. Use vis_dat to check out the data. Does it need cleaning?
```{r}
vis_dat(airquality)
# Yes it needs cleaning there are missing values
airquality_clean <- na.omit(airquality)
```

## 3. Fit a linear model to the cleaned data to predict Ozone from one of the possible predictors of your choosing. Why did you chose thats variable?
```{r}
model <- lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = airquality_clean)
```

## 4. Using summary(), Does this seem like a valid model?
```{r}
summary(model)
```
